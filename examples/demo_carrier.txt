SNOW2 demo carrier — this text is intentionally boring.

Line 001: Nothing to see here.
Line 002: Still nothing.
Line 003: Just ordinary text.
Line 004: A tribute to clever old-school demos.
Line 005: Whitespace can hide secrets.
Line 006: Cryptography protects meaning.
Line 007: Steganography hides existence.
Line 008: This carrier is long on purpose.
Line 009: Many lines are required right now because we embed 1 bit per line.
Line 010: Later we can increase density and add redundancy.
Line 011: For now we keep it simple and correct.
Line 012: SNOW2 is a modern rewrite with modern AEAD and Argon2id.
Line 013: XChaCha20-Poly1305 is used for authenticated encryption.
Line 014: The container header is authenticated as AAD.
Line 015: Tampering must fail closed.

Line 101: We need lots of lines right now.
Line 102: Because 1 bit per line is intentionally simple.
Line 103: Once we increase density, this can shrink a lot.
Line 104: But correctness first.
Line 105: And a fun tribute.
Line 106: SNOW2 ❄️
Line 107: Inspired by Matthew Kwan’s SNOW.
Line 108: Built in Rust.
Line 109: Modern crypto, old-school delight.
Line 110: End of short section.
